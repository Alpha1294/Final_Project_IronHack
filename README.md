## Markets, trade, and finance

* A journey through the Caos

## Motivation

+I always loved to unveil mysteries and well whats better to unveil that a mistery about money , AM I RIGHT people?
+I like puzzles and think about the data and his relationship with the model or with the results.

## My approach
+ I first got the data from binance api ,ohlc and then i downloaded sentiment data (link inside the code) , i also tried doing some techincal indicators , then i testes the gradient boosting classifier with all the diferent data to see how it behave after applying more data or less.

+I got the importance of the features to filter them and have less noise, made exploratory data(like SHAP value explanation) to better understand the why of each result.

+This was pretty much like a loop ,getting new features, eda, cleaning testing and putting away this result, at the end i compared all my results and chosed a data, then i tested that data with 10 different models and neuronal networks also.
Chosed one ,and then hyperparamether tuned it to get the best results using grid search.


## Credits

+Credits are for the amazing teachers that i have and that have teached us how to do all this in only 8 weeks.
+Also big applause to my cohort ,all them deserve that for theyre resilence!

#### Anything else that seems useful

+There are 3 jupyter notebooks ,one of them being the main one and the other 2 to create features and test neuronal networks
